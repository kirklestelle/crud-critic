Additional info:

1. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.

My friends Jacob Koch and Brooks Lobe along with many sources across the internet. 

2. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what?

no

3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

I lost count, but it was a lot. At least 25+ hours since I worked on it before and didn't finish it until now.

4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

I thought the problems were fair. I just had trouble understanding Parse and getting the average rating to show for a long time. I had a problem with my Parse and Raty scripts that I eventually learned was a load-order problem.
